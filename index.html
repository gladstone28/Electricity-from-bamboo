                <p>Learn about the sustainable harvesting and preparation of bamboo.</p>

            <a href="step2.html" class="card">
                <h2>Step 2:Gasification</h2>
                <p>The dried bamboo is then subjected to a process called gasification, where it is heated at high temperatures in a low-oxygen environment. This process converts the solid bamboo into a combustible gas mixture known as syngas (synthesis
                    gas), which primarily consists of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and some carbon dioxide. The gasification process is efficient and leaves behind minimal residues..</p>

            <a href="step3.html" class="card">
                <h2>Step 3: Cleaning and Conditioning of Syngas</h2>
                <p>The syngas produced from gasification contains impurities that need to be removed before it can be used for electricity generation. This step involves filtering out particulate matter, cooling the gas to remove moisture, and using scrubbers
                    to eliminate contaminants like tar and acids, which could damage downstream equipment.</p>

            <a href="step4.html" class="card">
                <h2>Step 4: Electricity Generation</h2>
                <p>The clean syngas is then directed into a gas engine or turbine, where it is burned to produce mechanical power. This mechanical power drives an electric generator, which converts the energy into electricity. The efficiency of this conversion
                    can be enhanced through the use of combined heat and power (CHP) systems, which capture and utilize the waste heat generated in the process, further improving the overall energy output.</p>

                <h2>Step 5: Distribution and Use</h2>
                <p>Finally, the generated electricity is stepped up to a higher voltage using transformers and transmitted through the power grid for distribution. It can be used for both residential and industrial purposes, providing a renewable source
                    of energy that contributes to reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.</p>
